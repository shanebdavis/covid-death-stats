# TODO

- Redo dataset to include All Ages data.
- sometimes a multi-selected field is "ignored" and only the first selected is used; need to solve that somehow;
- need to make a legend - or update the legend at the bottom to show:
  - what the axis is
  - what the 'columns' are (colors)
    - and how the colors map
  - try pie-chart for single-column datasets
  - mouse-over should show all the numbers you might want to know
- CSV export
- presets and preset tour
