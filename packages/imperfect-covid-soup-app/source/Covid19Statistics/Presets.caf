        # Understanding Covid-19 with Data

        Statistics and probability are hard to understand. Our biological hardware isn't good
        at assessing probabilities that didn't help us survive in the past - e.g. any probability less
        than about 1 in 100. In order to understand Covid-19, we need math to translate
        the data into something meaningful to help us make important decisions.

        Above is a typical chart of Covid-19 the death counts over time.
        Unfortunately, this is just data. It has no meaning. It cannot be
        used for any useful purpose in itself.

        # Covid-19 Death Risk over Time

        To give data meaning, it must be compared. Take the Covid-19 death count and divide it by the total population, and now we have
        statistics: the probably of death due to Covid-19.

        > Everything is relative. -Einstein

        Although we have transformed the data into potentially meaningful statistics, these probabilities
        are still significantly smaller than 1 in 100. We need something more to understand
        how to make day-to-day decisions around Covid-19.

        ### A Note About the Data

        All data in this tool comes from the CDC or the US Census. Click the data-sources link on the right for details.

        The facts, as best I can tell:

        * It's very hard to get reliable Covid-19 data.
        * Death data is perhaps the most reliable (each death is unlikely to be counted twice), but it is still troubled data.
        * Death counts between 1 and 9 cannot be reported due to CDC privacy guidelines. If you see "nulls" or number-ranges, this is why.
        * Covid-19 deaths are hard to define, but the definitions by the CDC and the WHO more-or-less translate to any death where Covid-19 might have been a contributing factor in any way. This rules out some deaths such as accidental deaths, suicides, murders and a few others, but it still leaves a lot of questions about how to actually assess the Covid-19 risk.

        It is important for each person to assess whether they think the Covid-19 Death Data from the CDC. Below is my best attempt at an unbiased interpretation, take it with a grain of salt:

        * At worst actual Covid-19 deaths are no more than twice the numbers expressed here.
        * Most likely, the CDC death counts are a good worst-case number.
        * Actual risk is probably less than the risks presented here.

        > Note: none of this data separates out co-morbidities. People who have no co-morbidities will have less Covid-19 death risk than the numbers presented here. People with co-morbidities may have higher risk.

        # Quantifying the Covid-19 Death Risk by Age Group

        Covid-19 has dramatically different death-risks depending upon age group. To get a sense of actual Covid-19 death risk and how it impacts
        daily lives, I think it's most useful to examine the risks for three different age groups: Older, middle and younger people.

        ### How to Interpret the Graph:

        * Numbers represent the chance of dying from Covid 19 for each age group.

        # Age 65+: Covid-19 Death Risk

        We'll focus first on the most at-risk population: people 65 years old and older.

        # Age 65+: Average Additional Life Expectancy Due to Covid-19 Death Risk

        This graph is simply the inverse of the previous page.

        A surprizingly simple result of probability theory is that by inverting the probability
        of an invent, you get the average number of times you must sample from that probability
        before the event happens.

        For example, if you wanted to know how many times you must roll a 6-side die before you
        get a 5 (or any other specific number), all you have to do is take the probability of rolling
        a 5, which is 1 in 6, and invert it to get 6. On average, you will have to roll the die 6 times to get
        a 5.

        ### Quantifying Older Ages Death Risk

        * The most at-risk population of all, 85+, could expect to live on average another 51 years (age 132) if Covid-19 was the sole death risk.
        * In other words, if, year after year the covid death risk remained the same, and there were no other death risks, people 85+ would have to wait an average of 51 years before Covid-19's death risk catches up with them.

        ### How to Interpret the Graph:

        * Numbers represent the average number of years each cohort can expect to live if Covid-19 was the only death risk.
        * %region%, %age%, %time%
        * Note: this assumes the death risk stays the same year after year after year ad infinitum.

        # Comparing Suicides (2019) and Covid-19 Death Risks (%time%)
        >-- Suicides: 2019, Covid-19 Death Risks: %time%

        Another useful way to understand probabilities is to compare them with other, known probabilities. In this graph we find a startling comparision. Our youth are many times more likely to commit suicide than they are to die of Covid-19.

        In order to minimize deaths and maximize life, we logically should invest proportionally in each death-risk. Over investing in one risk inceases the chance of overall death by neglecting the other death-risk probabilities.

        ### How to Interpret the Graph:

        * Numbers represent the number of times more likely each cohort is to commit suicide (2019 full-year probabilities) vs chance of dying during the time period from Covid-19.
